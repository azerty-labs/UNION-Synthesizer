# UNION- Synthesizer

> A synthesizer in the crowd with webaudio.

This project aims to quickly deploy an FM synthesizer in a master class to explain its concept.

The synthesizer is coded in web-audio and is integrated in a web server. The user only has to connect to a server via his mobile phone in order to access to the FM synthesizer. The sound is generated directly by the smart-phone.

This synthesizer can also be used to play several participants simultaneously.
